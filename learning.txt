My under standing of this project

We are developing a API with FastAPI which perdicts
weather the out is positive, nutral or negative based on the
text input we give [POST]

Data set that we give is data.csv --> text, label

we are using scikit-learn modle for model traing

Our model is trainded by two process which are piplined


model = Pipeline(
    [
        ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer()),
        ('clf', LogisticRegression())
    ]
) # A Pipeline in scikit-learn connects multiple ML steps into one single model object.


>> ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer()) --> Convert text → numerical vectors
    > Computer doesn't understand text

        Computers don’t understand text.
        So:

        "I love this product"
        becomes something like:

        [0.00, 0.78, 0.00, 0.45, 0.12, ...]


        This is called TF-IDF encoding.

        It gives:

        High value to important words

        Low value to common words like is, the, and

>> ('clf', LogisticRegression()) -->  Learn patterns & predict sentiment

Despite its name, it is not for regression here.
It is a classification algorithm.

Your model is doing:

Text → Positive / Negative / Neutral


So Logistic Regression finds a decision boundary between these classes.

LogisticRegression: [https://realpython.com/logistic-regression-python/#classification]
    > Logistic regression falls under classification
    > What is classification? -  classification is an area of supervised machine learning
        that tries to predict which class or category some entitiy belongs to, based on the feature.
    > There are two types of classification
        1) Binary - Two optiones to choose eg: True or Flase
         2) multiclass - More than two optiones like this model positive, nuteral or negative.
Note: Regression - Problems have continuous and unbounded outputs.Eg: Salary of an employee based on exp or education
      classification - Problems have bounded output. Eg: Grade of an employee based on years of experience,
                        which will be like 1-3 years - C1, 3-6 - c2.
